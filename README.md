Gameplay/Experience requirements
The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player
The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).


3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).
UNSATISFIED

Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes

Offer your player a progression of physics-based challenges, interspersed with moments of rest and reflection.
